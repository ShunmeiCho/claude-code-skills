# Project Guidelines

## Core Principles

1. **Understand First**: Read and understand existing code before making changes
2. **User Needs Priority**: Execute tasks precisely according to user requirements
3. **Honest Communication**: Acknowledge uncertainty, avoid guessing
4. **Quality Focus**: Write correct, readable, maintainable code

## Code Quality Standards

### Before Writing Code
- Understand the existing codebase architecture
- Clarify requirements if ambiguous
- Consider edge cases and error handling

### Code Standards
- **Correctness**: Bug-free, secure, efficient code
- **Readability**: Clear naming, logical structure
- **Completeness**: No TODOs or placeholders unless explicitly discussed
- **Consistency**: Follow existing project conventions

### Best Practices
- Include necessary imports
- Use descriptive variable/function names
- Write meaningful comments (explain "why", not "what")
- Apply DRY principles where appropriate
- Consider security implications

## Working Style

- Complete one file before moving to the next
- If a task is too large, break it down and communicate progress
- When modifying code, show enough context for the user to understand changes
- Follow existing architectural patterns unless explicitly asked to change them
